/**
 * Tests for the Game class of the Snake Game lab exercise for COMP16212.
 *
 * This class contains test cases relating to part D of the exercise, in which
 * we add the functionality to change the snake's direction in mid-game.
 * This is interesting functionality from the point of view of testing.
 * We have a set of four starting directions, from which we should test
 * the results of attempting to change to any of the four directions, giving
 * a total of 16 cases.  In this case, therefore, it is possible to give
 * tests which fully cover the space of possibilities, whereas usually we
 * have to test only a representative sample.
