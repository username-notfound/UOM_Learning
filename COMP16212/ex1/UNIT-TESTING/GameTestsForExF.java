/**
 * Tests for the Game class of the Snake Game lab exercise for COMP16212.
 *
 * This class contains test cases relating to part F of the exercise, in which
 * we add the cheat functionality.
 *
 * As we progress through the more complex snake game functionalities, so
 * (unsurprisingly) the test code is getting more complex.  For the tests of
 * the cheat functionality, we need to set up a game grid that has a snake
 * with a known score that has crashed in some way.  We can't directly
 * set the state of the game grid, so we have to use the public methods on
 * Game that are available to us to create the situations we want to test.
 *
 * In particular, we need to set up a snake with a known score.  Since we
 * can't set the score directly from outside the Game class, we need to
 * manufacture a situation in which the snake acquires a known score, by
 * eating some food with a fixed move value.
 *
 * The game starts off with a score of zero, and we want to change this to
 * some known value after one piece of food has been eaten.  In other words,
 * we need to ensure that:
 *
 *  moveValue * ((snakeLength / (gridSize * gridSize / 36 + 1)) + 1) = 100
 *
 * If we have a snake that is shorter than (gridSize^2 / 36 + 1) then the
 * middle component of this score will be 0, and the overall value added to
 * the score will be moveValue.
 *
 * So, to set up the game, we need to choose appropriate values for the grid
 * size, the snake length and move value.  Then we get the snake to eat a
 * piece of food that we place in front of it.
 *
 *
 * This test case illustrates the kinds of hoops we have to jump through when
 * code is written long before the tests for the code are written.  The code
 * was not written with testability in mind, and therefore it does not provide
 * us with the hooks we need to easily control the state of the snake game and
 * set up particular game situations for testing.  This is not a criticism of
 * the Snake Game code.  It is a general feature of even well-written code
 * that was created without accompanying automated test code.  In later course
 * units, we'll explore how this property can be exploited to help us write
 * highly readable and maintainable code from the get-go.  For now, it is enough
 * just to experience the challenges of writing tests for code that was not
 * written with testing in mind from the outset.
