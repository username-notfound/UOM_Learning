/**
 * Tests for the Game class of the Snake Game lab exercise for COMP16212.
 *
 * This class contains test cases relating to part E-5 of the exercise, in which
 * we give the snake the ability to eat food, and gain a score.
 *
 * When food is eaten, lots of things should change: the position of the food,
 * the length of the snake, the score and the score message should all change.
 *
 * We should therefore write tests at the boundary values for the snake length
 * and the score. The other two effects probably just need one test between
 * them. (To fully test the random placing of the food, we should really write a
 * test that runs several times, but we'll not bother with that for this
 * exercise.)
