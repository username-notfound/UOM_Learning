/**
 * Tests for the Game class of the Snake Game lab exercise for COMP16212.
 *
 * This class contains test cases relating to part G of the exercise, in which
 * we add the ability to place trees on the grid, that the snake can crash
 * into.
 *
 * There is quite a lot of functionality to add for this exercise, and therefore
 * quite a lot of tests to think about.  We have to test:
 *
 * - the placing of trees on the board
 * - the removal of trees from the board
 * - the snake crashing into the trees
 *
 * We also have to test that existing parts of the code behave sensibly
 * in respect of trees:
 *
 * - that the grid is initialised with 0 trees to begin with
 * - that the score is calculated correctly in the presence of trees
 * - the addition of a new tree to the board when food is eaten
 *
 * That's a lot of test cases to cover, and ideally we would split this test
 * class into several smaller classes, each focusing on one part of the
 * functionality.  For now, though, I'm going to retain the structure where
 * the test cases for one exercise are kept in a single test class.  You can
 * let me know if this was the wrong decision for your particular brain.
 *
 *
 * You may start to find the test suite more useful from this stage, as if
 * your changes break any of the earlier functionality you have already
 * implemented, there is a chance that the test failures will point it out
 * to you.  Remember to run the test suite frequently (ideally, after every
 * small code change) to get the most value out of it as an early warning
 * indicator of unintentional regression of earlier functionality.
 *
 *
 * A complicating factor in the implementation of these tests is that the
 * Game class maintains a private field recording information about the number
 * of trees on the board.  We can place trees on the board where we like, by
 * changing the type of specific cells, but we can't update this private
 * variable by any means other than by calling the public methods on the Game
 * class.  So, our only means of placing a tree with the current version of
 * the code is to make the snake eat some food, so that the Game class adds
 * a new tree.  We can set the moveValue to 0 for this, so that the score
 * is not affected.  But we have very little control over exactly where the
 * tree will be placed, which adds an element of randomness into the tests
 * (something to be avoided wherever possible).
 *
 * All this means that if you get an individual failure of a test from this
 * test class, try running the tests again several times to make sure it is
 * a systematic failure, and not the result of this random tree placement
 * problem.
