/**
 * Tests for the Game class of the Snake Game lab exercise for COMP16212.
 *
 * This class contains test cases relating to part A of the exercise, in which
 * we add some very basic functionality, to set the author and the score
 * message.
 *
 * The test cases for this functionality are both very simple, and show how a
 * basic mutator/accessor pair is tested using JUnit.
 *
 * In practice, we wouldn't bother to write tests for such simple code,
 * especially if (as is best practice) the code for the accessors and mutators
 * are generated automatically by the programming environment. But, they make
 * very suitable first tests for students learning JUnit for the first time.
 *
 * I've given quite a lot of comments in this first file, to help you figure out
 * what is going on. In later files, I've added comments only when there was
 * some new testing feature to talk about, or where I felt the code was a little
 * hard to follow.
 *
 * Good luck!
 *
